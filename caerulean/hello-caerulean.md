### Introduce your project

We like to recommend that you use this template to write a quick first post about a project.

> Keep it short. You can do this in one sitting.

Think of this like your project's README, except with less focus on documentation and more on what it does and the motivation behind it.

Feel free to add some links, images, or whatnots to better show of your description.

Future posts are for specific features or solutions, but the convention is for the first one to be an introduction!
