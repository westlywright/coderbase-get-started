### What is a root post?

This post is sitting within the root folder of your new repository. Posts that are not in a project folder are simply 'root' posts - no project, so they show up only when looking at a list of all posts.

Use root posts for anythign that isn't project-specific

### Tell the world who you are

This post is a great one to keep around (just change the content)! Use this one to give an introduction to yourself and what you do. Other people coming to your page can then get to know you.

You might want to keep the 'Hello' title, it is a good convention to show that it is your introductory post!
